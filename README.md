 We will understand the business objective and understand the data using univariate and multivariate analysis. Then we'll build supervised learning models, choose the best among them and analyze the 
 financial benefits of the analytics project.<br>

The objective is to reduce the customer acquisition cost by targeting the ones who are likely to buy and to improve the response rate, i.e. the fraction of prospects who respond to the campaign.
Now there are two problems with including the variable ‘duration’ in the model:<br>
• The prospect data procured by the marketing team does not contain ‘duration’, since
the call has not been made yet.<br>
• In our analysis of marketing cost and response, you assumed that the cost of a phone
call is independent of its duration (₹1 per call), which is not true.<br>


To solve these problems, we should resolve to build another model without including the variable ‘duration’. This will help you understand the relationship of the other variables with the response.
Also, set the business objective to achieving 80% of total responders at the minimum possible cost. The total number of responders is the total number of prospects who responded, from the available data of about 45,000 prospects.
Based on this information, calculate the X in the top X%, i.e., how many prospects should be called to meet the business objective. Further, create a presentation for the CMO highlighting the results and the methodology employed.
